# About_me

Hi,
I'm an aspiring self taught web developer and I'm hopeful to get my first job in this field. 
I'm trying to make a strong case to be given a chance to get hired, since I'm self- taught and don't have a real job experience yet. 

I have finished my first project with a startup company LukuLab, which creates Dyslexic children reading abilities and finished this prototype of interactive exercises. I'd appreciate a feedback as I'm ready to take the plunge.

"Happy Coding"!
